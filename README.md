# FollowTheLady

About the Repository  
This repository is linked with an Android Studio project that aims to create a simulation of the popular fair game “Follow the Lady”.   
The linking of the repository only uploads the Java class files automatically but the code can’t be executed directly without resource files like the XML files that it is dependent on.  
The manually uploaded APK that has been generated for debugging can be run installed on any Android phone that has an API version higher than 15.   

About the Project  
The aim of the game is to keep track of the Queen of Hearts as the cards are upturned and switched around.   
This version supports both Portrait and Landscape mode.  
It also offers a variety of difficulties through 9 levels that have an increasing number of switches and 3 speed options.  


This code is written and maintained by Srishti Agarwal.
